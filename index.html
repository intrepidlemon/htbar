    <div id="about">
      <p>"How to be an academic radiologist" (HTBAR) is a two-week course for our first-year radiology residents at Penn Radiology, designed to support Penn's mission of academic radiology. The course began 14 months after our program director, Dr. Mary Scanlon, started at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006. She worked with Dr. Elias Melhem, now chair of Radiology and Chief of Enterprise Radiology &amp; Imaging Clinical Services at Thomas Jefferson University. HTBAR program launched Winter 2008. An insightful first year resident, Jason Itri, knocked on Mary's door after the first program to suggest the course had greater potential if a few changes were made; with that, resident organizers came into existence. Since then, HTBAR has evolved significantly, separating the two weeks, adding essentials like lunches as well as substantial opportunities for personal development and Socratic discussion. You will recognize many names on the list of prior organizers: Terence Gade, Jeff Ware, Austin Pantel, Mark Sellmyer, Colbey Freeman. Over 19 years, HTBAR has continued to morph and evolve to suit the needs and interests of today's residents and has become a favorite part of the R1 year!</p>
