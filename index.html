    <h1>Penn Radiology - HTBAR 2024</h1>
    <div id="about">
      <p>“How to be an academic radiologist” (HTBAR) is a two week course for our first year radiology residents at Penn Radiology, designed to support Penn’s mission of academic radiology. The course began shortly after our program director, Dr. Mary Scanlon, started at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 2000s. She worked with Dr. Elias Melhem, now chair of Radiology at University of Maryland and then Chair of Neuroradiology and Vice Chair for Academic Affairs to found the course. In 2008, an insightful first year resident, Jason Itri, knocked on Mary’s door to suggest the course had greater potential if a few changes were made; with that, resident organizers came into existence. Since then, HTBAR has evolved significantly, adding on essentials like lunches but also substantial opportunities for personal development and socratic discussion. You will recognize many names on the list of prior organizers: Terence Gade, Jeff Ware, Austin Pantel, Mark Sellmyer, Colbey Freeman. Over the years, HTBAR has continued to morph and evolve to suit the needs and interests of residents and has become a favorite part of the R1 year!</p>
