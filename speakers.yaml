    Mark was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he developed a deep appreciation for corn-on-the-cob and a love of Husker football. After soaking in the sweetness of a college town in the midwest, Mark attended M.I.T. and majored in Chemistry (BS) with a concentration in Music. During his undergraduate degree, Mark joined Joe Jacobson's group called the Molecular Machines Lab in the M.I.T. Media Lab. The interdisciplinary nature of that environment, combining engineering with chemistry and biology, was inspiring and fostered the habit of doing experimental science at the same time as attempting to accomplish other things. That habit transformed into a full-blown MD/PhD in the Stanford MSTP program. At Stanford, Mark trained in chemical biology with Tom Wandless and found translational applications for new technologies using molecular imaging with Chris Contag. The natural combination of these fields are the foundation of his research today. Mark then came to the University of Pennsylvania as a research track radiology resident and completed a Nuclear Radiology fellowship. If he isn't in his office thinking “deep thoughts” or reading scans as a radiologist in the clinic, he's probably playing with his four kids, his wife, and their black lab in the backyard while growing and eating corn.

While in Cali he picked up biology and psychology degrees, a spouse from the PNW, and an undying love for both quantitative neuroscience and Zachary’s pizza. He worked his way up from undergrad lab rat to manager at the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Science Research, performing some of the first quantitative MRI studies on neurogenetic diseases -- most notably Williams syndrome and 22q11.2. He then returned to Richmond to learn statistical genetics from the gurus at the Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, and completed his MD/PhD dissertation on the genetics of neurodevelopment in collaboration with NIMH Intramural. After a brief New Haven detour for internship (and more pizza), he landed at Penn for both research track residency and neuro/informatics fellowships, finishing up in 2016. He is now an Assistant Professor of Radiology and Psychiatry, and has been part of the Penn family for 13.5 years (which coincidentally is the exact age of his third child).

    Dr. Dinglasan is an Assistant Professor at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine and at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, and a full time breast/body/IR attending at the Bay Pines VA in sunny St. Petersberg, FL. She serendipitously discovered radiology as a medical student at Yale while taking a late 4th year elective to contemplate her surgery future after a particularly misogynistic away surgical rotation… and never looked back. While at Penn for radiology residency, Dr. Dinglasan’s love for education and teaching flourished under Mary Scanlon, and since the core of her interests always intersected with people, pictures, and patient care, specializing in IR and breast imaging was a natural fit (even though they are at two different ends of the radiology spectrum!). As she went pedal to the metal as a full-time radiologist in academia (week long trauma call, IR, ER coverage, breast, abstracts, posters, meetings, winning Educator of the Year and the only Outstanding Physician Award ever bestowed to a radiologist at the university) while simultaneously giving birth to three girls in three years… she discovered a mass that would change her life. Come along on the journey she took which eventually led her to the VA- where she is still a full-court press radiologist, clinician and educator but also has time to be a hard-core hands on mom, community volunteer, novice fencer, amateur pianist, foodie traveler, and most importantly expert chocolate chip cookie baker.
