  bio: "Michael C. Soulen, MD FSIR FCIRSE is Professor of Radiology and Director of Interventional Oncology at the University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center and Director of Clinical Research in the Division of Interventional Radiology. His major clinical and research focus for the past 30 years has been image-guided cancer therapy (interventional oncology), with a specific focus on embolotherapy and ablative therapy of solid tumors in the liver and kidney. Animal research includes swine, rabbit, and rat models for liver-directed therapies, investigating novel embolic agents, novel ablation devices, and ultrasound-mediated drug delivery using novel drug-loaded microbubble contrast agents. Clinic trials focus on embolotherapies for primary liver cancers, liver metastases from colorectal and neuroendocrine tumors, and renal cell carcinomas. Current clinical investigations focus on synergy between locoregional and systemic therapies, including 1) pharmacologic modulation of the metabolic stress response under conditions of embolic ischemia; 2) IR therapies as immunostimulants combined with immune checkpoint inhibition, 3) radioembolization with radiosensitizing drugs; 4) serial biopsy for tumor cell culture, rapid drug screening, sequencing and testing in PDX mice, with the goal of personalized precision medicine; and 5) the first international randomized trial comparing embolotherapy techniques for neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases. Dr. Soulen received Research Mentor awards from the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiology and the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society and the Gold Medal from the Society of Interventional Radiology."

  sid: hyland
  name: Stephanie Hyland, PhD,
  bio: |
    Stephanie Hyland, PhD, is Senior Researcher in the Healthcare Intelligence group at Microsoft Research in Cambridge.
    Her research interests are in modelling medical time series (especially complex physiological ones) for real-world problems, and making machine learning useful for healthcare. This means working closely with clinical collaborators to identify important problems where machine learning can support human experts, as well as thinking carefully on how we evaluate and validate our models. As part of this, she is also interested in privacy-preserving machine learning, because responsible use of machine learning on healthcare data requires respecting the sensitive nature of that data.
    Prior to joining the healthcare intelligence team at MSR Cambridge, she completed her PhD at Cornell University/Weill Cornell Medicine/Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Computational Biology and Medicine, and studied Theoretical Physics and Applied Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin (BA Mod.) and Cambridge University (Part III; MASt).

  name: James Eric Schmitt, MD, PhD
  bio: "Eric grew up in the semi-rural outskirts of Richmond, Virginia, suffused with Gen X angst and the smell of tobacco. Desperate for change, he moved to Silicon Valley for college. While in Cali he picked up biology and psychology degrees, a spouse from the PNW, and an undying love for both quantitative neuroscience and Zachary’s pizza. He worked his way up from undergrad lab rat to manager at the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Science Research, performing some of the !irst quantitative MRI studies on neurogenetic diseases -- most notably Williams syndrome and 22q11.2. He then returned to Richmond to learn statistical genetics from the gurus at the Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, and completed his MD/PhD dissertation on the genetics of neurodevelopment in collaboration with NIMH Intramural. After a brief New Haven detour for internship (and more pizza), he landed at Penn for both research track residency and neuro/ informatics fellowships, !inishing up in 2016. He is now an Assistant Professor of Radiology and Psychiatry, and has been part of the Penn family for 12.5 years (which coincidentally is the exact age of his third child). He strives to make meaningful contributions to all aspects of Penn’s tripartite mission--despite pressures for increasing specialization--and is occasionally successful. He is the Associate Director of the Penn Neuraxis course, has won the neuro division teaching award 2 of the last 3 years, and had the highest-rated resident neuro lecture last year."

  name: Mark Sellmyer, MD, PhD
  bio: "Mark was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he developed a deep appreciation for corn-on-the-cob and a love of Husker football. After soaking in the sweetness of a college town in the midwest, Mark attended M.I.T. and majored in Chemistry (BS) with a concentration in Music. During his undergraduate degree, Mark joined Joe Jacobson's group called the Molecular Machines Lab in the M.I.T. Media Lab. The interdisciplinary nature of that environment, combining engineering with chemistry and biology, was inspiring and fostered the habit of doing experimental science at the same time as attempting to accomplish other things. That habit transformed into a full-blown MD/PhD in the Stanford MSTP program. At Stanford, Mark trained in chemical biology with Tom Wandless and found translational applications for new technologies using molecular imaging with Chris Contag. The natural combination of these !ields are the foundation of our research today. Mark then came to the University of Pennsylvania as a research track radiology resident and completed a Nuclear Radiology fellowship. If he isn't in his o$ice thinking “deep thoughts” or reading scans as a radiologist in the clinic, he's probably playing with his three kids, his wife, and their black lab in the backyard while growing and eating corn."

kim:
  sid: kim
  name: Phillip Kim, MD, MPH
  bio: Phillip Kim initially joined medicine to become a surgeon, then initially joined radiology to become an interventionalist, and then finally decided to become a diagnostician. His interests have evolved over time. During residency at Georgetown, he ventured out and developed a 3D printing lab with his mentor in his office. His most proud print is an interactive Couinaud segmentation model of the liver. He loves every single aspect of abdominal imaging but particularly PIRADS. Phillip completed informatics fellowships at Georgetown and Penn. His special interests are radiology workflow optimization and its interplay with human behavior. He implemented lab values on the Epic reading palette and cleverly named the project the CLEVER (Clinical Lab Value Extraction for Radiology) project. His current works include Sectra display protocol development, ED-Radiology collaborative initiative in reducing over-utilization of CT GI Bleeding studies, reduction in inappropriate retroperitoneal US within 24 hours of CT for AKI, etc. Phillip currently serves as the fluoroscopy modality chief and Sectra liaison.
