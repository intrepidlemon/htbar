    Dr. Batlle is a cardiothoracic and musculoskeletal radiologist with an unusual training and professional path since he started Penn Med in 1999. He spent a little extra time at Penn and collected two additional degrees -- an MBA and an M. Bioethics -- ostensibly out of curiosity rather than professional launch delay. After training at Mass General Hospital, he returned to his Miami hometown to serve Baptist Health South Florida, the largest health system in Miami-Dade, via its radiology group, Radiology Associates of South Florida (a RadPartners group). In Miami, he served as team radiologist for the Dolphins, Heat, Panthers, Inter Miami, and FIU,  belonged to the cardiac imaging team performing more than 5000 coronary CTA per year, and developed the lung cancer screening program as well as the radiology pathways for the lung tumor team at the then-new Miami Cancer Institute. Along the way he has been active in publications and meeting presentations annually, on the SCCT as board member and committee chair, as well as at the ACR, where he serves as Florida Radiological Society President and Council Steering Committee member. In 2021 he took an unconventional professional course, moving his family to Boulder, Colorado, first as a day-work full-time partner for RASF and then eventually as a part-time employee for RASF and almost-full-time employee of Penn Medicine as a Clinical Associate Professor. He plays a lot of recreational Ultimate frisbee, enjoys crossword puzzles and word games, and spends family time with his wife Kathy, three screenagers, and a lab mutt named Poe.

    Mark was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he developed a deep appreciation for corn-on-the-cob and a love of Husker football. After soaking in the sweetness of a college town in the midwest, Mark attended M.I.T. and majored in Chemistry (BS) with a concentration in Music. During his undergraduate degree, Mark joined Joe Jacobson's group called the Molecular Machines Lab in the M.I.T. Media Lab. The interdisciplinary nature of that environment, combining engineering with chemistry and biology, was inspiring and fostered the habit of doing experimental science at the same time as attempting to accomplish other things. That habit transformed into a full-blown MD/PhD in the Stanford MSTP program. At Stanford, Mark trained in chemical biology with Tom Wandless and found translational applications for new technologies using molecular imaging with Chris Contag. The natural combination of these fields are the foundation of his research today. Mark then came to the University of Pennsylvania as a research track radiology resident and completed a Nuclear Radiology fellowship. If he isn't in his office thinking “deep thoughts” or reading scans as a radiologist in the clinic, he's probably playing with his four kids, his wife, and their black lab in the backyard while growing and eating corn.

    Julia Birnbaum, MD is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Radiology and one of our stellar breast attendings. She is originally from Long Island and if you ask nicely might get her to slip into a true ‘Noo Yawker’ accent! She has lived in 7 states on both coasts and visited 41 states and Puerto Rico and counting. She did a fellowship in Women’s Imaging at Penn in 1997 and never left. Julia has worked in both breast and ultrasound, but more recently been only in the breast department where she is an expert in ultrasound and image guided interventions.

    She once thought she wanted to do medical segments on news broadcasts and so spent some time working at KABC-TV in Los Angeles where she researched and produced medical segments. She also contributed to a medical documentary, book, and cookbook on high cholesterol.

    She is a mom of 4 (ages 16--36) and grandmom of a newborn, and has a 6 year old poodle. When not reading mammograms she can be found reading psychological thrillers, listening to country music, catching a Broadway show, or relaxing at the Jersey shore.
