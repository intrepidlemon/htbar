His major clinical and research focus for the past 30 years has been image-guided cancer therapy (interventional oncology), with a specific focus on embolotherapy and ablative therapy of solid tumors in the liver and kidney. Animal research includes swine, rabbit, and rat models for liver-directed therapies, investigating novel embolic agents, novel ablation devices, and ultrasound-mediated drug delivery using novel drug-loaded microbubble contrast agents. Clinic trials focus on embolotherapies for primary liver cancers, liver metastases from colorectal and neuroendocrine tumors, and renal cell carcinomas. Current clinical investigations focus on synergy between locoregional and systemic therapies, including 1) pharmacologic modulation of the metabolic stress response under conditions of embolic ischemia; 2) IR therapies as immunostimulants combined with immune checkpoint inhibition, 3) radioembolization with radiosensitizing drugs; 4) serial biopsy for tumor cell culture, rapid drug screening, sequencing and testing in PDX mice, with the goal of personalized precision medicine; and 5) the first international randomized trial comparing embolotherapy techniques for neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases.

  bio: "Eric grew up in the semi-rural outskirts of Richmond, Virginia, suffused with Gen X angst and the smell of tobacco. Desperate for change, he moved to Silicon Valley for college. While in Cali he picked up biology and psychology degrees, a spouse from the PNW, and an undying love for both quantitative neuroscience and Zachary’s pizza. He worked his way up from undergrad lab rat to manager at the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Science Research, performing some of the !irst quantitative MRI studies on neurogenetic diseases -- most notably Williams syndrome and 22q11.2. He then returned to Richmond to learn statistical genetics from the gurus at the Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, and completed his MD/PhD dissertation on the genetics of neurodevelopment in collaboration with NIMH Intramural. After a brief New Haven detour for internship (and more pizza), he landed at Penn for both research track residency and neuro/ informatics fellowships, !inishing up in 2016. He is now an Assistant Professor of Radiology and Psychiatry, and has been part of the Penn family for 12.5 years (which coincidentally is the exact age of his third child). He strives to make meaningful contributions to all aspects of Penn’s tripartite mission--despite pressures for increasing specialization--and is occasionally successful. He is the Associate Director of the Penn Neuraxis course, has won the neuro division teaching award 2 of the last 3 years, and had the highest-rated resident neuro lecture last year."

  bio: "Mark was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he developed a deep appreciation for corn-on-the-cob and a love of Husker football. After soaking in the sweetness of a college town in the midwest, Mark attended M.I.T. and majored in Chemistry (BS) with a concentration in Music. During his undergraduate degree, Mark joined Joe Jacobson's group called the Molecular Machines Lab in the M.I.T. Media Lab. The interdisciplinary nature of that environment, combining engineering with chemistry and biology, was inspiring and fostered the habit of doing experimental science at the same time as attempting to accomplish other things. That habit transformed into a full-blown MD/PhD in the Stanford MSTP program. At Stanford, Mark trained in chemical biology with Tom Wandless and found translational applications for new technologies using molecular imaging with Chris Contag. The natural combination of these !ields are the foundation of our research today. Mark then came to the University of Pennsylvania as a research track radiology resident and completed a Nuclear Radiology fellowship. If he isn't in his o$ice thinking “deep thoughts” or reading scans as a radiologist in the clinic, he's probably playing with his three kids, his wife, and their black lab in the backyard while growing and eating corn."

     I am a New Jersey native. I love the east coast living with beaches and mountains.
     My Penn journey started in 2014 as the HUP MRI manager and transitioned in 2022 to HUP Assistant Director of Radiology in the Patient Safety and Quality division. I have been in radiology for over 25 years to understand all facets of radiology- from the technical aspect to management through this quality leadership position. I have worked in non-profit, for-profit, union, nonunion, acute care, and community-based care. I have spent a lot of that time in directly serving care to patients in CT & MRI. Now in my current position- continuing to care for the caregivers on a higher level- including clinical teams, managers, and radiologists.
     My goal is strengthening our HRO culture with constant quality monitoring and providing the resources to improving our workflow within each radiology division. I collaborate with lean six sigma style task forces that keep moving toward common patient care goals. My position is to raise awareness in healthcare process improvement initiatives that helps remind us of the significant impact we provide on patient care and treatment.
