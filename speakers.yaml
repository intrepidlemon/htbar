While at Penn for radiology residency, Dr. Dinglasan’s love for education and teaching flourished under Mary Scanlon, and since the core of her interests always intersected with people, pictures, and patient care, specializing in IR and breast imaging was a natural fit (even though they are at two different ends of the radiology spectrum!).

    Mark was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he developed a deep appreciation for corn-on-the-cob and a love of Husker football. After soaking in the sweetness of a college town in the midwest, Mark attended M.I.T. and majored in Chemistry (BS) with a concentration in Music. During his undergraduate degree, Mark joined Joe Jacobson's group called the Molecular Machines Lab in the M.I.T. Media Lab. The interdisciplinary nature of that environment, combining engineering with chemistry and biology, was inspiring and fostered the habit of doing experimental science at the same time as attempting to accomplish other things. That habit transformed into a full-blown MD/PhD in the Stanford MSTP program. At Stanford, Mark trained in chemical biology with Tom Wandless and found translational applications for new technologies using molecular imaging with Chris Contag. The natural combination of these fields are the foundation of his research today. Mark then came to the University of Pennsylvania as a research track radiology resident and completed a Nuclear Radiology fellowship. If he isn't in his office thinking “deep thoughts” or reading scans as a radiologist in the clinic, he's probably playing with his four kids, his wife, and their black lab in the backyard while growing and eating corn.
