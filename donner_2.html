    <h2>Directions to Donner 2 Conference Room</h1>
    <div id="about">
      <p>To get to the Donner 2 conference room, the easiest way is to find the cafeteria/Starbucks on the second floor of the old hospital. If you are facing the cafeteria from the hallway and look left, you should see the following view:</p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_1.jpg"/>
      <p>Head down this hallway and then turn left just after the stairwell. As you turn left, you should see this view:</p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_2.jpg"/>
      <p>Head down this hallway until you see the sign that says Donner Conference Room. You have arrived!</p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_3.jpg"/>
      <p>If you are having trouble finding the cafeteria, the easiest way is to ask someone. However, here are instructions for how to find it yourself.</p>
      
      <p>From the main entrance of the old hospital, go up the escalators:</p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_4.jpg"/>
      <p>If you continue directly forward from the escalators, you should see the following view:</p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_5.jpg"/>
      <p>If you continue forward towards the Rhoads building (passing the sign that says Silverstein elevator and instead going towards the next sign that says Rhoads), you should see the following view:</p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_6.jpg"/>
      <p>Continue down the hallway into Rhoads. You will see a fork in the road. Stay right at this fork:</p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_7.jpg"/>
      <p>At the end of the hallway seen in the picture above, if you turn slightly to your left, you should see the following view:</p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_8.jpg"/>
      <p>Continue down this hallway. At some point, you will see a sign that says Stairs to Cafeteria. Go up these stairs and then follow signs to get to the cafeteria. </p>
      <img class="img" src="img/donner_2_9.jpg"/>
      <p>Note that you will pass by Donner 2 Conference Room once you're on the second floor on the way to the cafeteria (there will be a sign that says Donner Conference Room).</p>
