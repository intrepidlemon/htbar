    Dr. Gatenby is a practicing clinical radiologist and chair of the Radiology department of the Moffitt Cancer Center for the past 16 years. He spearheaded the formation of a new program at Moffitt titled Integrative Mathematical Oncology (IMO). The IMO brings to the Cancer Center a cadre of applied mathematicians to collaborate with tumor biologists and clinical oncologists. The goal is to use the mathematics developed for other nonlinear dynamical systems to examine the physiology of a tumor incorporating factors such as phenotypic evolution, intracellular communication pathways and interactions with microenvironmental factors including therapies. The program fosters continuous interaction between mathematicians and experimentalists as they form explicit comprehensive theoretical models to serve as a framework for understanding cancer’s development, progression and treatment. The IMO, led by Dr. Gatenby, represents an experiment in rethinking paradigms in medical research. A key purpose of the IMO is to provide the quantitative methods that will allow experimentalists and clinicians to frame their hypotheses, simulate their experimental design in-silico, and identify first principles that govern cancer growth and treatment. Dr. Gatenby aims to make progress using methods that have been successful in the physical sciences for centuries —through an iterative partnership between mathematically-oriented theoreticians, biologists and clinical physicians.

    Mark was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he developed a deep appreciation for corn-on-the-cob and a love of Husker football. After soaking in the sweetness of a college town in the midwest, Mark attended M.I.T. and majored in Chemistry (BS) with a concentration in Music. During his undergraduate degree, Mark joined Joe Jacobson's group called the Molecular Machines Lab in the M.I.T. Media Lab. The interdisciplinary nature of that environment, combining engineering with chemistry and biology, was inspiring and fostered the habit of doing experimental science at the same time as attempting to accomplish other things. That habit transformed into a full-blown MD/PhD in the Stanford MSTP program. At Stanford, Mark trained in chemical biology with Tom Wandless and found translational applications for new technologies using molecular imaging with Chris Contag. The natural combination of these fields are the foundation of his research today. Mark then came to the University of Pennsylvania as a research track radiology resident and completed a Nuclear Radiology fellowship. If he isn't in his office thinking “deep thoughts” or reading scans as a radiologist in the clinic, he's probably playing with his four kids, his wife, and their black lab in the backyard while growing and eating corn.

While in Cali he picked up biology and psychology degrees, a spouse from the PNW, and an undying love for both quantitative neuroscience and Zachary’s pizza. He worked his way up from undergrad lab rat to manager at the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Science Research, performing some of the first quantitative MRI studies on neurogenetic diseases -- most notably Williams syndrome and 22q11.2. He then returned to Richmond to learn statistical genetics from the gurus at the Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, and completed his MD/PhD dissertation on the genetics of neurodevelopment in collaboration with NIMH Intramural. After a brief New Haven detour for internship (and more pizza), he landed at Penn for both research track residency and neuro/informatics fellowships, finishing up in 2016. He is now an Assistant Professor of Radiology and Psychiatry, and has been part of the Penn family for 13.5 years (which coincidentally is the exact age of his third child).

    Dr. Dinglasan is an Assistant Professor at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine and at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, and a full time breast/body/IR attending at the Bay Pines VA in sunny St. Petersberg, FL. She serendipitously discovered radiology as a medical student at Yale while taking a late 4th year elective to contemplate her surgery future after a particularly misogynistic away surgical rotation… and never looked back. While at Penn for radiology residency, Dr. Dinglasan’s love for education and teaching flourished under Mary Scanlon, and since the core of her interests always intersected with people, pictures, and patient care, specializing in IR and breast imaging was a natural fit (even though they are at two different ends of the radiology spectrum!). As she went pedal to the metal as a full-time radiologist in academia (week long trauma call, IR, ER coverage, breast, abstracts, posters, meetings, winning Educator of the Year and the only Outstanding Physician Award ever bestowed to a radiologist at the university) while simultaneously giving birth to three girls in three years… she discovered a mass that would change her life. Come along on the journey she took which eventually led her to the VA- where she is still a full-court press radiologist, clinician and educator but also has time to be a hard-core hands on mom, community volunteer, novice fencer, amateur pianist, foodie traveler, and most importantly expert chocolate chip cookie baker.

Zafar, MD, MHS, received her BA in Biological Basis of Behavior at the University of Pennsylvania in 1995, her MHS with a concentration in Health Policy from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1998, and her MD from Jefferson Medical College in 2002. After completing her radiology residency and Abdominal Imaging fellowship from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in 2008 she joined the faculty in the Department of Radiology at the Perelman School of Medicine, where she is now an Associate Professor. Her research focus is in identification of gaps at the intersection of clinical medicine and radiology care systems and the design of novel interventions that positively impact the practice of evidence-based radiology. She has published on optimizing the reporting, management, and outcomes of non- emergent actionable imaging findings, evidence based clinical decision support at the time of image order entry, and comparative effectiveness in cancer imaging.

She has almost 16 years of working experience in Radiology, with many years of practical experience in pediatric and adult imaging in critical care and outpatient environments, in both diagnostic imaging and MRI. She has been an employee in the Penn Medicine Health System coming up on 12 years. She started her career at HUP as an MRI Technologist after the successful completion of the now defunct MRI Internship Program. She transitioned to her current role in 2019 after completing a master’s degree in Organization Development and Leadership as she wanted to be an effective leader in radiology with emphasis on patient care. Working in quality has provided her with that experience. She likes to remember, the patient is the number one priority in healthcare, and even though she no longer provides direct patient care, her role allows her to focus on patient safety while making improvements ensuring that patients have a positive experience in Penn Radiology's care. She manages the radiology quality improvement system called QUIQ-Rad, which is a low-level event reporting system specific to radiology. She is also responsible for auditing and tracking the reporting of critical values/results to ensure they are communicated accurately and timely.
